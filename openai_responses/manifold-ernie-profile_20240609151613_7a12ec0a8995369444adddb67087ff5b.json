  "summary": "<h2>Changes to the Announcement Section</h2><p>The importance of these changes is 3. The primary modification involves updating profile details within the announcement section, including the text inviting users to join and add comments. The old profile was: 'Please join and add comments! Thanks! Or contact me on the manifold discord!' Changed to new profile: 'Profile, with newlines, images, and links, is here!  Please join and add comments!  Thanks! Or contact me on the manifold discord! <a target=_blank href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kHT_RCVSSlrxENtSFbTx2Kw78kmW0WoWfRQYSJXrOf8/edit>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kHT_RCVSSlrxENtSFbTx2Kw78kmW0WoWfRQYSJXrOf8/edit</a> This change aims to provide more detailed information about the profile, perhaps to draw more attention or engagement with Ernieâ€™s profile content.</p><h2>Image and Social Link Updates</h2><h3>Avatar Update</h3><p>The user's avatar has undergone slight modifications for better presentation. Old image: <img class='with-max-width' src='https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mantic-markets.appspot.com/o/user-images%252FStrayClimb%252FfFdjzywOTA.jpg%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Df61be426-ce94-43e0-8761-3d26c24f8466' alt='Ernie old avatar'>, New image: <img class='with-max-width' src='https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mantic-markets.appspot.com/o/user-images%252FStrayClimb%252FfFdjzywOTA.jpg%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Df61be426-ce94-43e0-8761-3d26c24f8466' alt='Ernie new avatar'>. These updates might have been made to optimize performance or improve visual consistency across devices.</p><h2>Updates to Navigation Links</h2><p>Substantial revisions in the navigation options have been made. The text content of navigation links remains consistent, but there are slight modifications to in-line SVG icons (e.g., stroke-width or alignment properties), aiming to enhance user interface aesthetics. These are mainly maintenance changes that don't impact user content but improve visual clarity and user interaction. Therefore, their priority is lower.</p>",
